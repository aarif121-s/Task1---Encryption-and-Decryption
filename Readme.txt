# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption (Java Swing)

##  Project Overview
This project is a Java Swing based GUI application that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by providing a shift value.

The application demonstrates basic cryptography concepts along with Java Swing GUI and event handling.

How Caesar Cipher Works
Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the text is shifted forward or backward
by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example:
Text: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted Text: KHOOR
